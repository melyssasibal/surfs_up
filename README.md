# SQLite - Weather Data 

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide analysis of temperatures for Oahu. This analysis aims to give insight to year-round sustainability of a surf and ice cream shop business. The data has been provided in a SQLite file. Temperatures and precipitation data have been collected from nine weather stations. 

## Results

Analysis of the weather data included summary statistics of all June and December temperature data from all stations.

**December Temperatures Summary**

**Analysis of Summaries**

Based on the data, the results find:
- Average temperatures in June and December do not differ by much (74 degrees in June and 71 degress in December). This suggests that summer and winter weather in Oahu do not seem to differ that much in terms of average temperature. 
- While the minimum is 56 degrees in December, the maximum is calculated to be 83 degrees, which is a reasonable temperature for customers to potentially buy ice cream or go surfing. 
- While June temperatures have 1700 data points, December has 1517. Not having as many data points could cause an inaccurate calculation of summary statistics for December data. 

## Summary
The comparison of temperature data in June and December in the provided dataset suggests that summer and winter temperatures are fairly similar in Oahu. While temperatures drop slightly more in December, maximum temperatures match closely to the June maximum, which shows that there are still warm days in December for ice cream and surfing. Based on the analysis performed, the data seems to suggest that an ice cream and surf shop business could be lucrative in Oahu. However, further analysis could be conducted. 
- Analysis of June and December data grouped by years. The current statistics summary is calculated using all of June temperatures and all of December temperatures throughout the years of data collection. A closer look at the summaries by years would give insight into how consistent the temperatures are 
- Analysis of June and December data grouped by stations. Because the weather data is collected by nine different stations, it would be interesting to look at how the data differs by station. The data does not provide information about where the stations are located or if possibly, one station is more accurate that another. Looking at the data by stations would be helpful in determining if one station was skewing data.
